# 14 Layouts   

A page is UI that is unique to a route.   
A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages in the app.   

How to create layout.  
* you can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a layout.tsx file.   
* That component should accept a children prop that will populate with a child page during rendering.  


nextjs already provide "layout.tsx" file.   
inside the "app" folder you can find file named "layout.tsx". This file follows special fine naming convention in the app router. This partiular layout.tsx file in the app folder serves as the top most layout and referred to as the root layout. Root layout is is mandatory layout for every nextjs application. Nextjs automatically generate this file even if you deleted. 

1. show how "page.tsx" repalce with "children" in the browser.   
>src/app/layout.tsx   
```tsx 
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Next.js',
  description: 'Generated by Next.js',
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <!--following children will replace with "src/app/page.tsx" -->
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

2. show how to add header and footer to our children in "layout.tsx" file.  

>src/app/layout.tsx   
```tsx 
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Next.js',
  description: 'Generated by Next.js',
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <header 
          style={{
              backgroundColor:"lightblue",
              padding:"1rem"
          }}
        >
          <p>Header</p>
        </header>
          {children}
        <footer
          style={{
              backgroundColor:"ghostwhite",
              padding:"1rem"
          }}
        >
          <p>Footer</p>
        </footer>

      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```
